### Hello! 👋

- Studying software engineering at McMaster University. Currently seeking Summer 2024 internships!

- In the past, I've worked for a variety of companies and institutions as an intern, ranging from education to energy ⚛️.

- My main interests when it comes to software are logistics (e.g. scheduling of trains), making music education and production more accessible,
and the intersection of software with the nuclear industry.

- Outside of school, I am a huge fan of sports (golf, hockey, and skiing), music (in particular jazz), and all things related to public transit. 🚆
