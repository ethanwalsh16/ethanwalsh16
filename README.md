### Hello! 👋

- Studying software engineering at McMaster University.
  
- In the past, I've worked for a variety of companies and institutions as an intern, ranging from education to energy. ⚛️

- My main interests when it comes to software are making music education and production more accessible, the intersection of software with the nuclear industry, and applications of transit logistics.

- Outside of school, I am a huge fan of sports (golf, hockey, and skiing), music (in particular jazz), and all things related to public transit. 🚆
