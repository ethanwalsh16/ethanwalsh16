- Currently studying software engineering at McMaster University with co-op.
  
- In the past, I've worked for a variety of companies and institutions as an intern, ranging from education to energy.

- My main interests when it comes to software are making music education and production more accessible, the intersection of software and clean energy industries, and new developments in the field of digital ethics.

- Outside of school/work, I am a huge fan of sports (golf, hockey, and skiing), music (in particular jazz), and public transit.
